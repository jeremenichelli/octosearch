# OctoSearch

Web app that lets you check info about GitHub users.

[https://jeremenichelli.github.io/octosearch](https://jeremenichelli.github.io/octosearch)

Just put a GitHub username inside the input box and press **SEARCH** and you'll get the basic information of the developer, a list of the repositories and a nice pie chart showing what are the languages he or she is using most.
